# Examples of Setup for N2S3 projects

This repository contains examples of how to setup a project using N2S3 [N2S3 (Nessy)](https://sourcesup.renater.fr/wiki/n2s3/start), the open source Neuromorphic Hardware Simulator.

## Three projects

- [n2s3_sbt_dependency](n2s3_sbt_assembly) is an SBT project including N2S3 as a dependency in a public replository (such as sonatype).
- [n2s3_sbt_jar](n2s3_sbt_jar) is an SBT project including N2S3 as an unmanaged jar in the project, and including all dependencies as resolved dependencies.
- [n2s3_sbt_assembly](n2s3_sbt_assembly) is an SBT project including N2S3 as a fat jar containing all dependencies.
